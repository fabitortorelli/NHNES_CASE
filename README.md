# NHNES_CASE

This is a case to analyze data related to depression disorder.

## Context

* The dataset is a result of a survey from NHNES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). The survey is carried out annually in the USA to assess the health and nutrition of adults and children
* This specific dataset covers the period 2005-2006
* The dataset was provided as part of the Estatística do Básico ao Avançado (EBA) course elaborated by Renata Biaggi

* We are interested in two main questions:

    * What is the profile of individuals (adults over 18 years old) with depressive symptoms in the USA in the period 2005-2006?
    * Are health habits and physical activity associated with lower rates of depression in this population?
